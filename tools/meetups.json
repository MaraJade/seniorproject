        "description": "<p>Thanks to Chartboost for hosting us!  We'll kick-off 2016 with two tech talks. </p> <p><b>Talk #1:</b> Introduction to Apache Tajo: Future of Data Warehouse </p> <p>Apache Tajo is a data warehouse system for Web-scale data. It provides virtual integration of a multitude of diverse data sources, thereby facilitating easy and rapid data integration which has been regarded as an essential, but heavy step in business intelligence. In addition, it has a fault-tolerable distributed query engine for accelerating query speed. With the “query federation” and “distributed processing” capacities, Tajo is capable of providing users with reliable and efficient analysis of Web-scale data spread on multiple sources. I will introduce Apache Tajo including its overall architecture, current state and challenges, and discuss advantages what Tajo can bring to users. In addition, I will give a demo of integrated data analysis with Tajo. </p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> Jihoon Son, Software Engineer, Gruter</p> <p><b>Bio:</b> Dr. Jihoon Son is a distributed system engineer at Gruter, which is a Hadoop-based big data infrastructure company of South Korea. He is one of the co-founders of Apache Tajo project, and now working on distributed query processing and query optimization of Tajo. He has several speaking experiences at international conferences such as ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access (MobiDE) and International Conference on Data Engineering (IEEE ICDE).</p> <p><b>Talk #2: </b>Machine Learning using your data in Spark &amp; distributing jobs on your YARN cluster </p> <p>There's a wealth of data on your cluster. Learn how to use the open source release of Sframes by Dato, Graphlab Create and Dato Distributed to develop your machine learning models without taking the data out of your cluster, and taking advantage of job distribution.</p> <p>In this session we will show you how to extract data from your spark cluster and convert it to an Sframe and  use Graphlab to build a model without it ever leaving your cluster. Next we will use Dato distributed to train the model and finally we will convert the Sframe back to RDD.</p> <p>Dato's machine learning platform makes sophisticated machine learning easy to build, instant to deploy and versatile to manage. In 2014 Dato (formerly known as Graphlab) certified the initial product Graphlab Create to incorporate large-scale machine learning and graph analytics algorithms at scale. Dato Distributed is the latest Cloudera certified product and is built to scale machine learning tasks by distributing machine learning jobs on a cluster of machines.</p> <p><b>Speaker</b>: Susan Romero</p> <p><b>Bio</b>: Susan is a software engineer with experience developing applications in research and enterprise environments. Prior to joining Dato, she created powerful solutions in Infrastructure and Platform as a Service offerings at the IBM SmartCloud Innovation Center and delivered middleware and applications in a customer-facing role for IBM Global Technology Services. She holds a Master’s in Computer Science from NJIT and a Bachelor’s in Fisheries and Wildlife Management from NCSU.</p>",

        "description": "<p>For this meetup we are excited to be join by the great Tim Berglund,  Director of Training at DataStax who will discuss Spark and see how it works together with Cassandra to deliver a powerful open-source big data analytic solution.</p> <p><br/><b>What You'll Learn At This Meetup:</b></p> <p>Apache Cassandra is a leading open-source distributed database capable of amazing feats of scale, but its data model requires a bit of planning for it to perform well. Of course, the nature of ad-hoc data exploration and analysis requires that we be able to ask questions we hadn’t planned on asking—and get an answer fast. Enter Apache Spark.</p> <p>Spark is a distributed computation framework optimized to work in-memory, and heavily influenced by concepts from functional programming languages. It’s exactly what a Cassandra cluster needs to deliver real-time, ad-hoc querying of operational data at scale.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll explore Spark and see how it works together with Cassandra to deliver a powerful open-source big data analytic solution.</p> <p><br/>*A big thank you to Comcast for hosting! Hope to see you all there.</p> <p><b>About Tim Berglund:</b></p> <p>Tim is a teacher, author, and technology leader with DataStax, where he serves as the Director of Training. He can frequently be found at speaking at conferences in the United States and all over the world. He is the co-presenter of various O’Reilly training videos on topics ranging from Git to Mac OS X Productivity Tips to Distributed Systems, and is the author of Gradle Beyond the Basics. He tweets as @tlberglund, blogs very occasionally at <a href=\"http://timberglund.com/\"><a href=\"http://timberglund.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://timberglund.com</a></a>, and lives in Littleton, CO, USA with the wife of his youth and their youngest child.</p>",

Hopefully everyone had a great holiday, and all geared up for the new year! </p> <p>We’re kicking off the New Year next Tuesday, January 12 at 6:30pm. Our guests for the evening are two well known Seattle entrepreneurs, twin brothers, and co-founders of <a href=\"http://www.tune.com/\">TUNE</a>. More about this unique duo below:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeebrown\">Lee Brown</a></p> <p>Co-Founder, Chief Architect</p> <p>Identical twin and co-founder Lee Brown leads the development of the core technologies of TUNE. From an early age of 11, his interest in programming and Internet technologies led the brothers to build websites for local businesses and eventually their own content driven websites. Building ad serving technology in 2006 led him to contribute a shared memory object to the Apache community. As Chief Architect at TUNE, Lee is on the front lines of scalability and flexibility, spearheading an API-driven data layer and creating unique solutions for utilizing Amazon Web Services to host all TUNE products and technologies for industry leading uptime and performance. Lee graduated from Babson College in Boston, MA.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrbrown\">Lucas Brown</a></p> <p>Co-Founder, Chief Product Officer</p> <p>Lucas and his twin brother Lee began their first businesses before starting high school in their hometown of Elma, WA. They quickly found this world suited them, launching other successful businesses in college and reporting their first million dollars in revenue as sophomores in their dorms. Developing unique solutions for their own ad network, Lucas had the foresight to white-label their technologies to empower other businesses, which quickly became the birth of TUNE. As Chief Product Officer, Lucas leads agile product teams that strive to quickly meet the needs of an ever growing client base. As a founder, Lucas supported the company in the beginning, growing to profitability by 2010. Lucas' expertise in complex business models, integrations, implementations, and his constant drive for innovation make him a cornerstone of this Seattle based startup. Lucas graduated from Babson College in Boston, MA.</p> <p>As usual, we’ll start at 6:30pm with a happy half hour, and begin the fireside chat, followed by Q&amp;A at 7pm - 8pm. We will end at 8:30pm.</p> <p>Hope to see you there, and hear about your holiday escapades!</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Chuks.</p>",

Trove provides methods to manage these databases throughout their lifecycle and perform operations like backup and restore, configure and operate complex topologies like replication and clustering, and manage the configuration settings of these databases. Trove currently supports relational databases like MySQL (including MariaDB and Percona), PostgreSQL, and Vertica, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, CouchDB, and Redis.</p> <p>An important aspect of Trove is that it is easy to add support for a new database and in this talk we illustrate how one can add support for a new database in Trove using the example of Apache HBase. In this presentation, we describe the architecture of Trove and the actual code changes required to add support for Apache HBase in Trove and demonstrate a simple Apache HBase database orchestrated by Trove.</p> <p><b><i>Reminders:</i></b></p> <p>• A light dinner and soft drinks will be provided <b>courtesy of Tesora </b>~ <b>6:15pm</b> and we will kick off the sessions ~ 7:00pm.</p> <p>• If you are interested in giving a Lightening Talk shoot us a note with a topic or just come to the session ready to speak!</p> <p>• <b>DON'T FORGET -</b> for security reasons, the NERD center requires attendees to show a government issued photo ID in order to gain access into the building.</p> <p>•<b> Parking: </b>Best option for parking is the NERD center parking garage which charges a flat rate after 4pm.</p>",

Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM </b><br/>  </p> <p><b>Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud</b></p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.</p> <p><br/>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:</p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss<br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing<br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.</p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p><br/><b>BigSQL 4.1. </b> Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM</p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.</p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources. </p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p>-  On-site valet $8 per car</p>",

Based on our experiences as team leaders, however, a bit of groundwork-laying and communication can make a huge difference in speeding up the onboarding process and achieving success in implementing Scala at large scale.</p> <p>In this talk, I will describe the Scala implementation process for Zalando’s brand solutions team - highlighting some of the difficulties of learning three things (functional programming, a new language and a new tooling system) simultaneously, and ways to overcome them. I'll wrap up by providing tips on how to ease Scala onboarding within your organization, so you can achieve the same fast results.</p> <p>As Delivery Lead, Brand Solutions at Zalando, Alexander Kops oversees development related to core functions important to Zalando's brand partners - from analytics to user services. This is his second stint with Zalando: In his previous turn with the company, he completely rewrote its PHP-based system to a modular Java-based architecture.<br/>As a Scala and Play Framework enthusiast, he is driving adoption of these technologies within Zalando. He has experience leading both front- and back-end engineering teams and has also helped lead Zalando’s intensive mentoring initiatives.</p> <p>LEVEL OF TALK: Beginner LANGUAGE: Talk: de / Slides: en</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>• NGINX - Der Zusatzmotor fürs Web </b></p> <p><b>SPEAKER: Sascha Ohms (@sn0opy)</b></p> <p>Ngin...was?

Once shards are started, they may be needed to be moved around. This can be due to a cluster topology change, data volumes or when someone instructed ES to so through the index management APIs. </p> <p><br/>We will cover these triggers and how ES executes on those decisions, moving potentially tens of gigabytes of data from one node to another, without dropping any search or an indexing request. We will finalize with the mechanics of full/rolling cluster restarts and the recent improvements such as synced flush, delayed assignment on node leave and cancelling ongoing relocations if a perfect match is found.</p> <p>As always there will be ample room for Q&amp;A about practically anything.</p>",

There will be food and plenty of time for one-on-one conversations.</p> <p><b>Upcoming session: </b>January 13th 2016: </p> <p><b>AWS Speaker:</b></p> <p><br/>Rahul Bhartia, Solutions Architect at AWS, will speak on \"<i>Hadoop Security: Finding the Right Model with EMR</i>.\"</p> <p>As more organizations use Hadoop to collect and analyze massive amounts of data, Hadoop security has become critical. Effective Hadoop security requires a holistic approach, covering areas such as physical and network security, authentication and authorization, and access controls. This session examines these areas and shows you how to leverage them with Amazon EMR and AWS. You will also learn how to improve security on Amazon EMR clusters—from private subnets to secure clusters.</p> <p><b>Guest Speaker: Netflix</b></p> <p>There will be a guest speaker Daniel Weeks, Engineering Manager at Netflix who will discuss how Netflix uses Spark &amp; Presto to complement their big data platform stack that started with Hadoop.

Architecting your application in a modular way and loosely coupling modules using micro services provides you with a nicely decoupled system that still works very efficiently. Designing, evolving and versioning a micro service architecture is not easy, and over time, several design patterns and best practices have evolved that help you.</p> <p><br/>We will watching a talk by Marcel Offermans, Software Architect &amp; Director at Luminis Technologies. The talk provides an overview of these patterns and practices, and gives examples that are taken from real-world systems. Building blocks for such applications are created in open source communities like Amdatu and Apache and a demo will be presented that shows off their capabilities.</p>",

Logging is critical, but the more experience you get, the more you take it for granted. And Log4j 2 has some cool new features you'll want to hear about (say goodbye to slf4j?).

Still, it would be easy to get misdirected or miss a turn on this loop, so let's stay together if we can, as there is much to see, and plenty of photo ops along the way. We will break for lunch/snacks deep in the heart of the mountains surrounded by massive hoodoos in a secluded canyon that hides the cascading waterfalls. </p> <p><b>THIS IS NOT A FITNESS HIKE</b>, so we will not be going overly fast (we like to keep a 2 mph pace for group hikes).  We will stop on occasion to enjoy the views and each others company. Please keep this in mind when deciding if you want to enjoy this hike with your fellow 3Hers.</p> <p>  <b>Distance:</b>  This hike is around 7 miles.</p> <p>  <b>Difficulty:</b> Moderately Difficult (due to elevation gain, route finding, and distance).  If you have no issues with elevation gains, route finding, and distance, you may find this easier than what we have noted here.  For others, this hike may be considered difficult.  However, for those hikers we have encountered over the years, this would be considered moderately difficult for the reason noted.  Only you can properly assess whether this hike is for you.  If you are unsure, please ask, and we will try to help. </p> <p>  <b>Accumulated Elevation Gain:</b> 1400 feet </p> <p>  <b>Hike Time:</b> This hike should take 3 to 4 hours depending on the group.</p> <p>  <b>Suggested Carpool location:</b> 9:30 am at the Home Depot at Power and US 60. Go east on the Superstition Freeway (US 60) to Superstition Springs Blvd. exit 187. Take that exit, turn right and go 1/2 mile east, across Power Road. Then turn left, toward Home Depot, at the second driveway. Park in the southwest corner of the lot, behind Burger King. The Home Depot address is 6838 E Superstition Springs Blvd., Mesa, AZ 85208.</p> <p>   Other carpool arrangements and spots can be made by agreement. Just use the \"Comments\" section to make a suggestion to your fellow hikers!</p> <p> <b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> Please state whether you will be at the carpool spot or, in the alternative, whether you will meet at the trailhead. This helps us, and your fellow hikers. You are responsible for yourself in this regard. There is no guarantee that anyone will be at the suggested carpool location. If no one has indicated they will be at the carpool location, please consider proceeding to the trailhead.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> No water or facilities at the trailhead. Please plan accordingly.</p> <p> <b>Directions to the Trailhead:  </b>Take U.S. 60 to Idaho Road (exit 196) and go north for 2.25 miles to SR88, the Apache Trail. Turn NE (slight right) on SR88 and continue about 5.5 miles or so to Nodak Rd. (It is the turn for the Mining Camp Restaurant, so look for the signs for that turn). Turn right at Nodak Rd. and then left at the 2nd Rd. (Mining Camp Rd.) and continue to follow the signs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, turn to the left into the parking lot, and park away from the restaurant on the west end of the lot.</p> <p>For those coming down the 101 to the 202, it is suggested that you exit at Brown Road (rather than going down to US 60) and take it east about 7.5 miles to AZ 88.  From there, turn left, and head to the Nodak Rd. turn noted above, and follow the remainder of those directions..</p> <p> <b>As always, bring lots of water (we'd recommend at least 2-3 liters), nutritious snacks, hat, sturdy footwear, sunscreen, camera, and your sense of adventure!</b></p> <p>Group size is limited by Superstition Wilderness rules.  As always, hiking has its dangers and you assume all responsibility in this regard.</p>",

What kinds of proxy patterns are available and how can you build patterns more effectively with these? Why is reflection needed for this? Most importantly, how can we only use the Core JDK? </p> <p>In this talk we will start from the basics and move straight on to DynamicProxies, Dynamic-/Static-ObjectAdapter, DynamicStaticProxies at runtime and more. Would it influence your team members to start using functional aspects in your Core Java Project? How can we combine this with other pattern, or maybe with another language such as Kotlin? </p> <p>We will have a detailed view on the possibilities to reduce the amount of code with this Pattern, and we will see how we could make it more generic. One of the main points will be the combination of these patterns with, for example NestedBuilder-Pattern and more. </p> <p>After this you will have a better understanding of this pattern group from the practical point of usage. All pattern are build up from scratch, to give a feeling of the way to develop your own pattern based on this talk, or how you could change it for the needs of your project. </p> <p>We will have a deep dive into this pattern group, which I am sure you will enjoy. This talk is based on the German book \"Dynamic Proxies\" written by Dr. Heinz Kabutz and Sven Ruppert. </p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>Sven Ruppert has been coding Java since 1996. He is a Fellow for reply based in Munich.</p> <p>In his free time he is regularly speaking at Conferences like JavaOne/Jfokus/Devoxx/JavaZone/and many more  and contributes to IT periodicals, as well as tech portals.</p>",

We are also creating a cybercriminal’s paradise, as the old perimeter-based model of data security—based on finding malware and data leaks— has become woefully inadequate at protecting all possible data access points and data stores. New security approaches assume that you are under attack and focus instead on protecting the data itself, even in computer memory—the target for a growing number of attacks. In this session, Protegrity CTO Ulf Mattsson will provide insight to address the following issues:</p> <p>•  Taking a data-centric approach to balancing the often-competing goals of improving data security while maximizing data value and productivity.<br/>•  Managing today’s threats while adapting to the ever-changing data security landscape of the future.<br/>•  Bridging the gap between security regulations, privacy, and compliance while still being able to provide powerful analysis and data insight.<br/>•  Selecting the best methods of protecting sensitive data at rest, in transit, and in use.<br/>•  Understanding why tokenization—the most effective form of PCI data security—is increasingly being used to protect PII and PHI as well.</p> <p><br/><b>Presenter Bio: </b>Ulf Mattsson</p> <p>Ulf Mattsson is the CTO of Protegrity. He created the initial architecture of Protegrity’s database security technology, for which the company owns several key patents.

As a result, we can deliver powerful systems that self-heal and flex under load, but face a new challenge. How do we know our application is working as expected? Why Reactive Monitoring of course!</p> <p><br/>In this session, we will cover the principles behind Reactive theory and discuss how Reactive Monitoring provides the insight needed for a healthy Reactive application.</p> <p><br/><b>About Duncan</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/7/f/600_444299263.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Duncan DeVore is co-author of \"Reactive Application Development\", Senior Software Engineer on the Monitoring team at Typesafe, open source developer and frequent speaker. He has been an avid Scala developer since 2009, holds two patents for software design and led the release of one of the first large-scale Reactive applications in 2012.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Distributed Real-Time Stream Processing: Why and How with Petr Zapletal </b></p> <p><br/>In this talk you will discover various state of the art open-source distributed streaming frameworks, their similarities and differences, implementation trade-offs, their intended use-cases and how to choose between them. Petr will focus on the popular frameworks including Spark Streaming, Storm, Samza and Flink. In addition, you will also explore theoretical introduction, common pitfalls, popular architectures and many more. The demand for stream processing is increasing. Immense amounts of data has to be processed fast from a rapidly growing set of disparate data sources. This pushes the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include trading, social networks, Internet of things or system monitoring, are becoming more and more important. A number of powerful, easy-to-use open source platforms have emerged to address this. Petr's goal is to provide comprehensive overview about modern streaming solutions and to help fellow developers with picking the best possible decision for their particular use-case. Join this talk if you are thinking about, implementing or have already deployed streaming solution.</p> <p><br/><b>About Petr</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/c/c/600_444299340.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Petr is a Software Engineer who specialises in the design and implementation of highly scaleable, reactive and resilient distributed systems.

It provides virtual integration of a multitude of diverse data sources, thereby facilitating easy and rapid data integration which has been regarded as an essential, but heavy step in business intelligence. In addition, it has a fault-tolerable distributed query engine for accelerating query speed. With the “query federation” and “distributed processing” capacities, Tajo is capable of providing users with reliable and efficient analysis of Web-scale data spread on multiple sources. I will introduce Apache Tajo including its overall architecture, current state and challenges, and discuss advantages what Tajo can bring to users. In addition, I will give a demo of integrated data analysis with Tajo. </p>",

As part of the demo, Pini will show our (top secret until now) drone application, which relies on Mantl's support for big data and whose API is composed of containerised microservices that are managed by Apache Mesos.</p> <p><i>Viktor is in software development industry for more than 20 years.

It is much too soon to know what the situation will be Thursday, but since our speaker is coming from Rochester I will try to keep on top of things. Should I decide it is necessary to cancel, I will send a meetup email to everyone who has rsvp'd, so please be sure to rsvp and also watch your mail on Thursday.  I will do this before noon. CW</b></p> <p>This meetup will be at 7:00PM on Thursday, January 14, in Talbert Hall 103 on the UB North Campus</p> <p><br/>Scott Mead is a Sr. Architect and founding member at the Open Source Consulting Group (OpenSCG).  Scott has 12 years of experience with the PostgreSQL database engine including, migrations to / from commercial and open-source RDBMS, application development, large-scale (500+ node) database administration and modification of the PostgreSQL kernel.  Lately, Scott has been highly focused on relational data in a horizontally-scalable world; integrating PostgreSQL with NoSQL data processing engines.</p> <p><br/><b>Talk: </b>What's the place of an RDBMS in a NoSQL world?  We will dive in to tools and tricks available to PostgreSQL developers and admins that allow us to take advantage of BOTH horizontally-scalable AND relational models simultaneously.</p> <p>Talbert Hall is more or less between the Governor's and Hochstetter parking lots. It is next to the Natural Sciences Complex. Room 103 is on the same level as the Hochstetter lots. No permit is required after 3:00 PM.</p> <p>We'll continue with light refreshments as we've been doing. Let's set 7:00 as the meet and get settled time with the talk starting at 7:15.</p> <p><br/><b>Special note from  Charlie:</b> I let the TV weather discussion scare me into calling off the November 12 session. I'm not sure how well I did at notifying people. If you care to send me a phone number ([masked]), I will call you if this happens again. If you do this, let me know if it is a cell number; in that case I will send a text. I promise not to give anyone else your number and it is very unlikely I will use it for any other purpose.</p> <p><br/>Our current sponsor is Stark and Wayne.

        "description": "<p>This is a strong out and back hike up to the Superstition Ridgeline via Hieroglyphic Canyon.  If you have done this hike before, or conquered something similar or stronger, such as, Flat Iron, Battleship, or the Ridgeline itself, then this may be right up your alley.  If you are unsure of your ability, this may not be for you, but please message us separately if you have questions about the difficulty.  If we have hiked with you, or if you have had the courtesy to complete your profile questions as to places you have hiked, we may be able to assist you in assessing your abilities in this regard.</p> <p>This hike comes in at just under 6 miles, with an elevation gain of just over 2300 feet.  We expect the group will take about 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours to complete the hike.  This canyon doesn't get a great deal of sun this time of year, so dress accordingly.  The water has been flowing due to recent rains, and we expect we'll see some evidence of that this weekend.  Although we do not expect to get wet, there may be a few spots along the route where water requires us to route find our way around.   </p> <p><i>Due to the nature of this hike, involving some off trailing and many unsigned junctions, it is recommended that we keep within close proximity of each other. We will stop at each junction to assure we have everybody, but if you are ahead of the hike leaders, you are on your own.  </i></p> <p><b>Distance:</b> 5.8 miles (approx.) <br/><b>Elevation Gain:</b> 2330 feet<br/><b>Hike Time:</b> Expect to spend 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours on this trek depending on the group. <br/><b>Difficulty:</b> This hike should be considered moderately difficult to difficult (tending more toward the difficult) depending on your abilities.  There is some exposure as we near the top, and some with fear of heights have struggled beyond this point. <br/><b>What To Bring:</b> Water, sunscreen, hat, camera, snacks/lunch, and sturdy footwear. </p> <p>Many find walking sticks/poles helpful on this hike, though they are not required. Gloves may also be of good use, as well as long pants on some sections. </p> <p> <b>Note:</b> There are no facilities at the trailhead.</p> <p><br/><b>SUGGESTED CARPOOLING:</b> 8:30 am at the Home Depot near Power and US 60. Go east on the Superstition Freeway (US 60) to Superstition Springs Blvd. exit 187. Take that exit, turn right and go 1/2 mile east, across Power Road. Then turn left, toward Home Depot, at the second driveway. Park in the southwest corner of the Home Depot lot, behind Burger King. The Home Depot address is 6838 E. Superstition Springs Blvd., Mesa, AZ 85208.</p> <p><b>DIRECTIONS TO THE TRAILHEAD:</b> From Phoenix, travel east on Route 60 east of Apache Junction to Kings Ranch Road. Take a left on Kings Ranch Road for about 2.5 miles to Baseline Road. At Baseline Road, take a right. Go .3 miles and turn left. (You'll see a sign directing you to the trailhead.) Go .4 mile to Valley View and turn left again. (You'll see another sign directing you to the trailhead.) Valley View will turn into N. Whitetail. Go .5 mile to a \"T\" and then turn right onto East Cloudview. Proceed for another .3 mile to the parking lot. From Kings Ranch Road to the trailhead, allow yourself 10 minutes driving time.</p> <p><br/><b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> (we don't want to leave anyone behind): Please state whether you will meet at the carpool spot or, in the alternative, whether you will meet at the trailhead. As always, if no one has indicated they will be meeting at the carpool location, please consider proceeding directly to the trailhead.</p> <p>As with all Superstition Wilderness hikes, the Forest Service imposes a limit of 15 hikers.  However, spots often open up the day before the hike.  So, don't be discouraged if this hike fills up.  You are encouraged to get on the waiting list, as there is a good chance you will get in to this great adventure! </p>",

        "description": "<p>Bosque del Apache is well-known as a great location for bird photography. Click on \"photos\" above this announcement for a few pics from my last visit. Plenty of information on-line. Take I-25 S past Socorro to exit 139, head E 1/2 mile then S to the refuge. It's well-signed. San Antonio where you head S is the last chance for gas, food etc. <b>These details are subject to change</b>! Please check comments especially the evening before the meetup.</p> <p><br/>The refuge has 2 driving loops each roughly 8 miles long. We'll slowly drive the loops stopping at various observation areas when we see birds or other wildlife. There are a couple of short walking trails too.</p> <p><br/>Phone me at[masked] or email me rpgbirds [at] aol.com. I need to know if you're coming so I can meet you at the refuge HQ. Feel free to post comments.</p> <p><br/>This will mostly be of interest to those who enjoy birds, and a longer lens is desirable, 300mm and up. Or point &amp; shoot with a longish zoom can work well too. Extra batteries and memory. Tripod?</p> <p>Bring food, water, warm clothing, sunscreen etc</p> <p><br/>Entrance fee $5 per vehicle [unless you have a pass]</p> <p><br/>I will probably stay in the area the night before and be out on the refuge before sunrise which is at 07:12. I plan to stay until or close to sunset 17:23</p> <p><br/>No good trying to take bird photos in the rain so <b><i>I WILL CANCEL IN THE EVENT OF BAD WEATHER</i></b></p>",

        "description": "<p>The use of DataFrames in Spark (introduced in Spark 1.3) is becoming more powerful with every subsequent release. While the use of RDDs is still a very effective way of processing data in Spark, the use of DataFrames confers advantages such as improved readability and faster processing. The functions work very well in pipelines and are easy to reason about since they provide better semantic information about data transformations. The speed benefit arises from DataFrame operations internally representing logical plans. Before execution, such plans are optimized by Catalyst and transformed into physical plans. Is it likely that DataFrames will become the primary API for most users, so it’s now a great time to dive into processing data with DataFrames in Spark.</p> <p>I’ll provide an overview of many of the functions introduced from Spark versions 1.3 to 1.6. Because examples are a great way to quickly gain understanding, I’ll provide plenty of those. These will be practical examples that are easily applicable to a variety of data transformation tasks. There will be a live-coding session to see Spark DataFrames used in step-by-step analyses. This will provide an opportunity for Q&amp;As and other participation amongst the Meetup members. I’m really excited to show you all the great new additions to the DataFrame API so I hope to see you all at the session!</p>",

Tendremos para inaugurar el año a dos grandes ponentes como Louis Dorard y Raúl Arrabales.</p> <p><br/>La agenda para este décimo meetup es la siguiente:</p> <p><b>18.30 - Acceso al auditorio</b></p> <p><b>18.45 - \"Pragmatic ML: simple tips and interesting research problems\"</b></p> <p><br/><i>How can you ensure that your work and use of ML gets the most impact in the domain you apply it to? From collaborating with all stake-holders to simulating how predictions will really be used, evaluating them domain-side and deploying models at scale in production, I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learnt when it comes to integrate ML in real-world applications. Also, I’ll review some research problems and new open source software aimed at making it easier to create, experiment with, and operationalise predictive models.</i></p> <p><b>Ponente<br/>Louis Dorard</b> I'm the author of <a href=\"http://www.louisdorard.com/machine-learning-book/\">Bootstrapping Machine Learning</a>, the first guide to Predictive APIs, and a co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.papis.io/\">PAPIs.io</a>­, the world's first conference on Predictive APIs and Predictive Apps. My goal is to help people use new machine learning technologies to make their apps and businesses smarter. I do this by writing, speaking and teaching.</p> <p><b>19.30 - \"</b><b>Sistemas Cognitivos Artificiales: cuando aprender no es suficiente\"</b></p> <p><br/><i>Las técnicas de aprendizaje automático a menudo tratan de imitar la capacidad que poseen muchos organismos biológicos para adaptarse y progresar en su ecosistema, ¿pero es el aprendizaje la única clave de su adaptación? ¿Qué más capacidades cognitivas requieren los organismos para competir en entornos complejos y desestructurados? En esta charla adoptaremos un enfoque amplio de la cognición desde el punto de vista de la neuropsicología cognitiva, poniendo foco en nuevas aplicaciones empresariales y las tecnologías que las pueden hacer posibles.</i></p> <p><b>Ponente<br/></b></p> <p><b>Raúl Arrabales</b> es ingeniero en informática, doctor en Inteligencia Artificial y MBA. En los últimos años ha liderado proyectos y startups de base tecnológica asumiendo diferentes roles, desde Jefe de Proyecto a CEO, en compañías como IBM, ARRIS, T-Online, Comaware y Altran.

Mit dem neuen Jahr haben wir auch die 300 Mitglieder Marke geknackt, was doch immer noch erstaunlich ist. Danke dafür :) Ich hoffe man sieht dieses Jahr ein paar neue Gesichter von denen, die sich noch verstecken ;)</p> <p>Das Meetup wird 2 Vorträge enthalten zu folgenden Themen:</p> <p>\"Fucked Up - Oder mein Weg zum Entrepreneur\" von Johannes Gerlach. Dabei wird er über seinen Weg sprechen, die Stolpersteine und Hürden, die man überwindet zum Entrepreneur. </p> <p>Der 2. Vortrag wird von Bastian Heist gehalten. Er spricht über Apache Cordova aka Phonegap und bringt uns da seine Erfahrungen näher. Dabei wird er auf die technische Funktionsweise eingehen, sowie eine kleine Beispiel App zeigen und etwas Live Coding. </p> <p>Anschließend folgen wieder Diskussionen und Networking. Eventuell gibt es noch ein Product Hunt Input mit The latest Greatest. </p> <p>Ich bin gespannt auf 2016 und freue mich über interessante Vorträge, neue Gesichter, spannende Diskussionen und viele nette Abende. </p> <p>Bis demnächst!</p>",

Solr is widely admired for its rock-solid full-text search and its ability to scale up to massive workflows. But Solr has moved beyond its roots as just a full-text search engine. Today, people use Solr for aggregating data, powering dashboards, geo-location, even building knowledge graphs!

Dockerfiles are essentially shell scripts together with a few specialized commands. So, if you can write a shell script to build your environment from a bare Linux install, you already have the guts of a dockerfile. Sharing and reuse of dockerfiles and images is supported to save effort and organize projects into layers. Learn how to use Docker to quickly spin up identical environments, harden and isolate untrusted code, and join together conflicting environments. Examples to include deployments of Apache Spark, an Ethereum GPU cryptocurrency miner, and a MeteorJS web application.</p>",

The features to be covered will at least include the following: Heatmaps: Solr can generate gridded facet counts, and fast. See a live demo; PackedQuadPrefixTree: A more compact and efficient alternative to QuadPrefixTree; FlexPrefixTree: A configurable spatial tree to balance index size with search speed; RptWithGeometrySpatialField: An RPT index paired with serialized geometry with an in-memory cache allows indexed shapes to be searched accurately and quickly; Geo3D: Polygons and other shapes computed on the surface of a sphere or ellipsoid. It’s also very fast when point data is pre-converted to 3 dimensions; GeoPointField: A leaner alternative to RPT; BKDTree / BKDPointField: An experimental Lucene codec for spatial data. It’s very efficient; RPT spatial indexes for non-point data are 40% leaner; find out how/why; Solr spatial ease-of-use improvements, to include distance units, a nicer Solr query parser, and GeoJSON format.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>David Smiley is a well recognized Apache Lucene/Solr expert. He wrote the first book on Solr, he's a Lucene/Solr committer and PMC member that improves Lucene and Solr, he speaks at conferences about it, he does training, and he offers part time independent consulting services / development. Much of Lucene's spatial module was developed by David.</p>",

This is a joint meetup with <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/austin-data-geeks/events/226676911/\"><b>Austin Data Geeks</b></a>. </i></p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>Chris is going to give two presentations with a 15 minute break in between. Expect an information windtunnel. </p> <p><b>1) Spark Core Performance Improvements</b></p> <p>This will be a code-level, deep-dive into the recent spark core performance Improvements that evolved out of the 100TB Daytona GraySort Challenge (Spark 1.1 &amp; 1.2) and Project Tungsten (Spark 1.5 &amp; 1.6). Both the 100TB Daytona GraySort Challenge (Spark 1.1 &amp; 1.2) and Project Tungsten (Spark 1.5 &amp; Spark 1.6) led to significant performance improvements in the Spark Core.  These improvements cover all key resources including disk I/O, network I/O, CPU, and memory. Through a series of demos and slides, we'll dive deep into the key performance improvements and understand how they acknowledge mechanical sympathy by reducing disk seeks, minimizing garbage collection, increasing CPU cache locality, saturating the network controller - destroying world performance records along the way.</p> <p><b>2) Approximations and Probabilistic Data Structures with Spark</b></p> <p>Code-level, Deep-Dive into approximations and probabilistic data structures such as CountMin Sketch, HyperLogLog, and BloomFilters within Spark Core, Spark Streaming, Spark ML, Spark SQL, BlinkDB, Twitter's Algebird, and Redis. <br/>Abstract<br/>First, we'll discussing the core fundamentals that make up these clever and mathematically-sound probabilistic data structures and algorithms.  <br/>Next, we'll discuss various use cases where approximations are useful -and often required!<br/>Lastly, we'll demo these gems in action using Spark Core, Spark Streaming, Spark ML, Spark SQL, BlinkDB, Twitter's Algebird, and Redis. </p> <p><b>Speaker Bio</b></p> <p>Chris Fregly is a Principal Data Solutions Engineer for the newly-formed IBM Spark Technology Center, an Apache Spark Contributor, a Netflix Open Source Committer, as well as the Organizer of the global Advanced Apache Spark Meetup and Author of the Upcoming Book, Advanced Spark. Previously, Chris was a Data Solutions Engineer at Databricks and a Streaming Data Engineer at Netflix.</p> <p>When Chris isn’t contributing to Spark and other open source projects, he’s creating book chapters, slides, and demos to share knowledge with his peers at meetups and conferences throughout the world.</p> <p>6:30 Networking</p> <p>7:00 Featured talks (Don't be late!)</p> <p><i>A special thanks to the folks at <a href=\"http://homeaway.com/\">HomeAway</a> for not only hosting, but also picking up the food beverage tab for this meetup.

This is a joint meetup with the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/austin-spark-meetup/events/226678379/\">Austin Spark Meetup</a>. </i></p> <p><b>Talks</b></p> <p>Chris is going to give two presentations with a 15 minute break in between. Expect an information windtunnel. </p> <p><b>1) Spark Core Performance Improvements</b></p> <p>This will be a code-level, deep-dive into the recent spark core performance Improvements that evolved out of the 100TB Daytona GraySort Challenge (Spark 1.1 &amp; 1.2) and Project Tungsten (Spark 1.5 &amp; 1.6). Both the 100TB Daytona GraySort Challenge (Spark 1.1 &amp; 1.2) and Project Tungsten (Spark 1.5 &amp; Spark 1.6) led to significant performance improvements in the Spark Core.  These improvements cover all key resources including disk I/O, network I/O, CPU, and memory. Through a series of demos and slides, we'll dive deep into the key performance improvements and understand how they acknowledge mechanical sympathy by reducing disk seeks, minimizing garbage collection, increasing CPU cache locality, saturating the network controller - destroying world performance records along the way.</p> <p><b>2) Approximations and Probabilistic Data Structures with Spark</b></p> <p>Code-level, Deep-Dive into approximations and probabilistic data structures such as CountMin Sketch, HyperLogLog, and BloomFilters within Spark Core, Spark Streaming, Spark ML, Spark SQL, BlinkDB, Twitter's Algebird, and Redis. <br/>Abstract<br/>First, we'll discussing the core fundamentals that make up these clever and mathematically-sound probabilistic data structures and algorithms.  <br/>Next, we'll discuss various use cases where approximations are useful -and often required!<br/>Lastly, we'll demo these gems in action using Spark Core, Spark Streaming, Spark ML, Spark SQL, BlinkDB, Twitter's Algebird, and Redis. </p> <p><b>Speaker Bio</b></p> <p>Chris Fregly is a Principal Data Solutions Engineer for the newly-formed IBM Spark Technology Center, an Apache Spark Contributor, a Netflix Open Source Committer, as well as the Organizer of the global Advanced Apache Spark Meetup and Author of the Upcoming Book, Advanced Spark. Previously, Chris was a Data Solutions Engineer at Databricks and a Streaming Data Engineer at Netflix.</p> <p>When Chris isn’t contributing to Spark and other open source projects, he’s creating book chapters, slides, and demos to share knowledge with his peers at meetups and conferences throughout the world.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>6:30 Networking</p> <p>7:00 Featured talks (Don't be late!)</p> <p><i>A special thanks to the folks at <a href=\"http://homeaway.com/\">HomeAway</a> for not only hosting, but also picking up the food beverage tab for this meetup.

Such applications can leverage these new, stronger guarantees of Cassandra for eliminating race conditions and temporary inconsistency that were otherwise not possible with eventual consistency alone. Of course, this new functionality comes at a cost.</p> <p>During this talk, we will discuss the guarantees provided by lightweight transactions and how this functionality can be used to develop distributed locks. We will go into details about the theoretical and practical challenges of building a distributed lock. Finally, we’ll present some use cases to which we’ve applied these distributed locks within our production environment at Hulu.</p> <p>*Thank you Hulu for hosting, hope to see you all there!</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>About Matt Jurik:</b></p> <p>Matt Jurik is a software developer at Hulu where he works on the core-services team building and scaling various backend services and databases.

Both of these were introduced into Adoreboard in 2015 - this talk focuses on how this enabled Adoreboard to release features faster, more reliably and with considerably less pain!</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Paddy Carey: BYOPaaS - Containers in practice</b></p> <p>So you have a container, now what? How do you actually run it in production? There are a lot of options available, you could use a hosted service like Amazon's Elastic Container Service, or maybe you want to retain control over your stack and run Deis or Kubernetes on your own hardware, or even just run the Docker daemon on a single machine.</p> <p>This talk chronicles a journey from \"OK, I have a container\" through several small-scale solutions, to hosted services and back again, ending up with a scalable, robust platform for running containers built atop Apache Mesos and Marathon.</p> <p><b>About Our Speakers</b></p> <p><br/><b>Paddy Carey </b></p> <p>bio TBC</p> <p><b>Bob Marks </b>Bob is Head of Engineering at <a href=\"http://adoreboard.com\">adoreboard.com</a>, a start-up company which specialises in text analysis, emotional extraction and analysing social data at large scale.  At Adoreboard, he has pioneered the development of real-time, highly scalable architectures using Java/Spring, Cloud Computing, SQL/NoSQL databases and messaging systems.

One year on he will be returning to talk about ODI Bristol and update the group on additions to the City's open data portfolio, including Bristol API (Transport).</p> <p>There's also a lot going on in open data in the region, outside of Bristol City Council and Jen Williams, from NetworkedPlanet, will be pitching an idea for South West Data to host an Open Data Camp, an \"unconference\", which would involve taking over the Watershed for a weekend and a mix of local, national and international (un)delegates.</p> <p>The meetup will allow time for, appropriately, open discussion, questions and answers from the speakers and the audience.</p>",

With systems such as Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra, applications can achieve millisecond-scale random access to arbitrarily-sized datasets. However, the scan performance of these systems is not optimal.</p> <p><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, columnar file formats such as Apache Parquet and Hive ORCFile are designed for very fast scan rates, offering great performance benefits to many SQL and analytics applications. Unfortunately, there is little to no ability for real-time modification or row-by-row indexed access when using these file formats.<br/>Kudu was designed from the ground up to address this gap. Kudu offers real-time random read / write access to records, while also storing data in a columnar format, providing both exceptional scan performance and competitive random access performance, combining many of the benefits of the above systems and formats. This talk will discuss how Kudu can be used as a single storage system to greatly simplify analytical big data applications.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Talk #3: Harnessing the power of unstructured data using Haven OnDemand, by Phong Vu, HPE</b></p> <p>HPE Haven OnDemand is a platform for building data-rich applications and analytics using text analysis, speech recognition, image analysis, indexing and search APIs. Simply put, developers and businesses use the Haven OnDemand APIs to add advanced capabilities such as natural language processing, machine learning, and predictive analytics to their applications.</p> <p>This talk will focus on Haven OnDemand platform’s capabilities of human information analytics and building advanced unstructured text indexes.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Speaker Bios:</b></p> <p>• <b>Mike Percy</b> is software engineer at Cloudera who has been working since 2013 on Kudu, an open source distributed column store for the Hadoop ecosystem that has recently joined the Apache incubator. He is also a committer and PMC member on Apache Flume. Prior to joining Cloudera in 2012, Mike worked at Yahoo! building machine learning infrastructure for big data. Mike holds an MSCS from Stanford University and a BSCS from UC Santa Cruz.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n• <b>Phong Vu</b> is a developer evangelist for Haven OnDemand at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Prior to joining HPE in 2015, Phong worked at Nokia and Microsoft on mobile technologies and Web services architecture.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Arrival and Parking</b></p> <p>Cask HQ is a few minutes walk from the California Avenue Caltrain Station. </p> <p>Also, Cask HQ has its own parking lot, but it will certainly not accommodate all guests.

Statically partitioning your datacenter makes it hard to grow and shrink your Jenkins cluster as the number of waiting builds changes, which means you either have resources lying idle or builds waiting for resources much of the time.</p> <p>By using Jenkins with the Mesos plugin, you can use the resource abstraction offered by Apache Mesos to easily share resources between Jenkins and other services running on a cluster of machines. This also allows you to run multiple discrete Jenkins instances that use the same resources, offering your developers a model like eBay's where each developer gets their own instance of Jenkins.</p> <p>The Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) is a distributed operating system built upon Apache Mesos that provides tools and services to make it incredibly easy to install and deploy Jenkins instances on the fly that are backed by a Mesos cluster. In this presentation, we'll introduce Apache Mesos, discuss how Jenkins integrates with Mesos and demonstrate how easy it is to bring up multiple Jenkins instances on DCOS.</p>",

In eCommerce, the online customer's \"information need\" is the desire to locate and obtain information about products. A naïve approach to product catalog search focuses entirely on the customer's query (submitted both explicitly and implicitly), and ranks the results using standard methods, such as TF/IDF. While this methodology may be good for general purpose eCommerce venues like online bazaars, it ignores the key tenet of the Department Store business model: Merchandising. The practice of Merchandising introduces a data curator's point of view. This new point of view expands the notion of information need, and imposes a tradeoff between natural and curated result. Moreover, it redefines the search result itself, demanding performant cross-entity false positive match elimination and dynamic grouping and ungrouping with respect to the relational eCommerce catalog structure. At Macy's we have expanded Solr with advanced Merchandising capabilities: fine-grained control of precision over recall, dynamic grouping and ungrouping of related entities, cross-entity match elimination, rule-driven search query rewriting, and combinatorial concept search. We will describe the history of Macy's implementation and highlight some lessons learned.</p>",

We will also briefly cover Spark Streaming and show some use cases where people have used it successfully including Web Trends that were able to push 10 million messages/sec using Spark Streaming. </p> <p>In this session we will be covering the following:</p> <p>• Apache Spark Overview</p> <p>• Whats new in Spark 1.6</p> <p>• Apache Zeppelin </p> <p>• Examples for BI and Data Scientists.</p> <p><br/>Our session will be led by Ned Shawa from Hortonworks. Ned is a diversified data engineer with over 10 years of experience in software and hardware, working currently at Hortonworks as a Solution Engineer for Australia and New Zealand. Prior to Hortonworks Ned worked at EMC where he was the Isilon &amp; Big Data Specialist for Australia and NewZealand. On top of his day duties, after hours Ned leads 2 major Apache Spark meetups in Melbourne  &amp; Sydney.</p> <p>Thanks to sponsorship from Hortonworks, we will be meeting at 6pm for pizza and drinks, following by the talk from 6.30 - 7.30pm. </p>",

Statically partitioning your datacenter makes it hard to grow and shrink your Jenkins cluster as the number of waiting builds changes, which means you either have resources lying idle or builds waiting for resources much of the time.</p> <p>By using Jenkins with the Mesos plugin, you can use the resource abstraction offered by Apache Mesos to easily share resources between Jenkins and other services running on a cluster of machines. This also allows you to run multiple discrete Jenkins instances that use the same resources, offering your developers a model like eBay's where each developer gets their own instance of Jenkins.</p> <p>The Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) is a distributed operating system built upon Apache Mesos that provides tools and services to make it incredibly easy to install and deploy Jenkins instances on the fly that are backed by a Mesos cluster. In this presentation, we'll introduce Apache Mesos, discuss how Jenkins integrates with Mesos and demonstrate how easy it is to bring up multiple Jenkins instances on DCOS.</p> <p><b>7:15 PM</b> : <b>Jenkins 2.0 Update - </b>Andrew Bayer, Jenkins Contributor</p> <p>\n\n\nSpecial <b>THANKS</b> to our sponsor</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/2/6/2/600_445477474.jpeg\" /></p>",

When it comes to using Open Source software, the truth lies somewhere in between, but that \"between\" is a huge area, and it's difficult to pin down. Knowing how to objectively assess the costs and impact of open source software within the business environment helps coders gain the respect and trust of their employers, while helping the employer make better, more profitable business decisions. The nature of open source software does not follow traditional economic analysis, nor does it lend itself to straightforward financial analysis. Factors like the organizational structure, corporate culture, and user experience play significant roles in the success or failure of open source software projects. Perhaps the most important aspect of open source, however, involves the motivation behind its very existence. Developers and business leaders who understand the \"why\" behind the existence of open source software, and how that ties in with major changes in the direction of future business operations will be signfiicantly more likely to make informed -- and profitable -- decisions.</p> <p><b><i>BASIC CONCEPTS SPEAKER BIOGRAPHY</i><br/>Steve Janss</b></p> <p>Steven L. Janss (MBA) was raised primarily in the Southeast, and attended high school near our nation's capital. After graduating from high school, he attended Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, working his way through school as a pool manager and water safety instructor, a manufacturing engineer, and an accountant, before receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in Finance, Insurance, and Business Law. He began his post-collegiate career as a data analyst with Booz-Allen before joining the Air Force and receiving his commission. Over the next twenty years, he flew B-52s and C-130s in both peacetime and combat roles throughout several theaters of operation on four continents. During this time, he also worked as an IT director, a classroom instructor, a director of academics, a liaison officer to the U.S. Army, and as a freelance writer for Network World. After retiring, he ran an outdoor adventure program in Colorado Springs for three years, before heading back to school to finish his MBA with honors, with a concentration in Technology Management. He is currently working on his Master of Science in Management, with a concentration in Project Management. Steve enjoys flying, camping, reading, writing, and spending time with his family and friends, particularly his teenage son, who is in the high school band. He is working on his second novel, a suspense thriller, and runs CSWriters, a fiction writing group. Future goals include completing a doctorate and teaching at either the high school or university level.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b><i> MAIN TOPIC ABSTRACT<br/></i>It Works on My Machine: Overview of Vagrant for Software Development</b></p> <p><br/>Vagrant is a command-line interface for simplifying the use of virtual machines (VM's). Vagrant allows teams to standardize their software development workflows by offering a uniform and portable interface to provision and run VM's on different operating platforms such as Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux and achieve identical results.  It supports all the major virtualization solutions such as VirtualBox, VMWare, and Hyper-V and supports configuration tools that range from simple shell scripts to powerful Chef and Puppet recipes. Developers simply invoke “vagrant up” and immediately enjoy a standard, consistent, and reproducible VM for software development and testing.</p> <p><b><i><br/></i></b></p> <p><b><i>MAIN SPEAKER BIOGRAPHY<br/></i></b> <b>Carlos Perez</b></p> <p>Mr. Carlos Perez has actively participated in the software industry for over 30 years and has been involved with all aspects of the software development life-cycle: requirements analysis, software architecture design, detailed design, coding, integration, and testing.

It offers the key benefits of Kafka such as scalability and fault-tolerance but as a service on the cloud. You connect to Message Hub using regular Kafka clients and programming interfaces, so you can think of it as Kafka on the cloud. Message Hub forms a messaging backbone for use in microservice architectures and for connecting to other services in the Bluemix cloud, such as streaming analytics. Come and hear about the challenges of creating a cloud service based on Kafka, how we've made it into a multi-tenant service and what Kafka in the cloud looks like.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n7.45pm - Break</p> <p>\n\n\n8.00pm - Talk - Streaming analytics made easy with Samsara by Bruno Bonacci</p> <p>Real-time analytics is a common problem which modern businesses have to tackle.<br/>Most solutions available require extensive design and development, expensive licenses, or they have poor extensibility and inflexible query models.<br/>Samsara Analytics is an open-source attempt to simplify a complex problem by combining powerful products like Apache Kafka and ElasticSearch and adopting simple processing patterns with a modern data-oriented language such as Clojure. The system is the combined experience of two solutions I've built for Tesco's Hudl tablet, and Channel4 video on demand. I will detail architectural choices and processing patterns which make Samsara ideal for large volume streaming analytics.<br/>Although the talk will be focused on what Samsara has to offer and how it differs fromother streaming solutions, most of the patterns could be used in other contexts.</p> <p>Bruno is a freelance software architect with over 20 years of experience, he helps data oriented companies to make sense of their huge volume of data using BigData technologies or building bespoke solutions.<br/>Bruno is currently BigData Architect at Channel 4 television working within the R&amp;D department to desing and build next generation data platforms. He previously worked for companies such Tesco, CISCO, Betfair and many more building high volumes and high performance systems.</p> <p>\n\n\n9.00pm - Pub</p>",

        "description": "<p>I'm a huge fan of Daniel Lemire's work on compressed bitmaps, sorted sequences of integers, and other data structures.  I'd say half the papers I have on my desk at work right now have his name on them.  I've invited him to speak at PWLMTL on his own work, rather than on a paper he loved, because <b>I</b> love his papers: I find them to be practical and accessible to the working developer in a way that few academic works manage to be.</p> <p><br/>He's going to speak about compressed bitmaps, in particular the Roaring bitmap approach he first published <a href=\"http://r-libre.teluq.ca/602/1/RoaringBitmap.pdf\">in this paper</a> (cited below).</p> <p><br/>The bitmap, especially in compressed form, is a very versatile data structure despite its apparent simplicity, and I invite all developers to consider it for many purposes.</p> <p>Just recently, I used compressed bitmaps in an application which needed to represent large sets of IP addresses efficiently.  In the last few years, I've used them in the implementation of a database system, an IMAP server, and a pubsub messaging system.  (Not to mention their ubiquity, uncompressed, in allocators of all sorts.)</p> <p>AdGear will be hosting us again for this meetup, and beer and pizza will be provided; feel free to come around 6 to eat and chat before the talk!</p> <p>\n\nAn abstract for the talk follows:</p> <p>\n\n\n<b> Better bitmap performance with Roaring bitmaps</b></p> <p><br/>Bitmaps are used to implement fast set operations in software. They are frequently found in databases and search engines.</p> <p>Without compression, bitmaps scale poorly, so they are often compressed. Many bitmap compression techniques have been proposed, almost all relying primarily on run-length encoding (RLE). For example, Oracle relies on BBC bitmap compression while the version control system Git and Apache Hive rely on EWAH compression.</p> <p>We can get superior performance with a hybrid compression technique that uses both uncompressed bitmaps and packed arrays inside a two-level tree. An instance of this technique, Roaring, has been adopted by several production platforms (e.g., Apache Lucene/Solr/Elastic, Apache Spark, eBay's Apache Kylin and Metamarkets' Druid).</p> <p>Overall, our implementation of Roaring can be several times faster (up to two orders of magnitude) than the implementations of traditional RLE-based alternatives (WAH, Concise, EWAH) while compressing better. We review the design choices and optimizations that make these good results possible.</p> <p>One interesting feature of this work is that it has been out in the open from the start. Roaring bitmaps is the result of a far ranging collaborative effort. We believed that it played a role in its success.</p> <p>If time allows, ongoing and future development efforts will be discussed.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About the speaker</b></p> <p><br/>Daniel Lemire is a computer science professor at the Université du Québec.

Having real-time access to the telemetry data is essential when responding to anomalies, visualizing several time-series signals, and discovering long-term trends in a multi-billion document dataset. Today, Elasticsearch is used to provide these capabilities for our missions giving operators a rich and flexible API into a scalable cluster of nodes. This talk will focus on how we scaled Elasticsearch for telemetry queries, the data ingest pipeline based on Apache Spark and how we orchestrate several clusters using Docker, Apache Mesos and Marathon. Together these tools give users a self-service platform for data exploration and discovery.</p> <p><i><b>Speaker Bio</b></i>:<br/>Dan is a Data Scientist in the Office of Chief Technology and Innovation at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he is using Elasticsearch to provide realtime analytics for the interplanetary missions at JPL. Dan has been at JPL for over 6 years and worked on various projects including the Curiosity Rover at Mars and the SMAP Spacecraft orbiting Earth. Dan has a passion for space, data, automation and writing tools that developers enjoy using.</p>",

With support for streaming, machine learning and most recently SQL, Spark aspires to become a player in the realm of real time analytics at scale. However, much of its underpinnings remain batch oriented and unsuited for highly concurrent OLAP workloads. In this talk, we will describe how we are innovating and renovating Spark's core underpinnings to make it suitable for real time operational analytics, helping create a unified platform that supports row and column data, high concurrency and approximate query processing at scale. </p> <p>Bio: <br/>Sudhir Menon is a founder and the COO of SnappyData.

        "description": "<p>Dans l'esprit des conférences qui fleurissent un peu partout en France (Mix-IT à Lyon, Breizhcamp à Rennes, Soft-Shake à Genève, RivieraDev à Nice, Bdx.io à Bordeaux, ...), celui-ci réunira 250 développeurs et développeuses autour de l'innovation et du développement (Web, Mobile, Java, Cloud, IoT, ... ) durant une conférence sur deux jours les 21 et 22 Janvier à Grenoble, suivie d’une “unconference” au ski le 23. Cette conférence technique cible les développeurs et les chercheurs, en les mélangeant pour laisser émerger l'innovation. Durant la session plénière, nous aurons des présentations éclair (de 5 minutes) au cours desquelles chercheurs, ingénieurs et doctorants présenteront leurs sujets de recherche. Depuis les débuts de l’électricité, Grenoble a toujours été un vivier d’innovation et d’excellence : des laboratoires et des industries de pointe y sont installés, elle a été classée 5e ville la plus innovante au monde par le magazine Forbes et est maintenant labellisée “French Tech”. Ici, l'innovation technique a trouvé ses racines dans les montagnes environnantes. C'est pourquoi le SnowCamp proposera suite à la conférence une journée \"unconference\" en altitude, sur les pistes de ski, lors de laquelle les participants pourront continuer à échanger de façon plus informelle et détendue, dans un cadre exceptionnel propice à la créativité. Les 21 et 22 Janvier venez donc participer au SnowCamp (<a href=\"http://snowcamp.io\" class=\"linkified\">http://snowcamp.io</a>) de 50 € pour les 2 Jours de conférence ou au tarif préférentiel (early bird jusqu’au 18 Janvier) de 100 € si vous y ajoutez la journée \"Université\" du 20 (1 journée d'atelier sur une thème technique: Apache Cassandra, ElasticSearch, OpenShift, OpenStack).</p> <p>Pour plus de détails : <a href=\"http://snowcamp.io\" class=\"linkified\">http://snowcamp.io</a></p> <p>Pour réserver ses places: <a href=\"https://yurplan.com/event/Snow-Camp/6343\" class=\"linkified\">https://yurplan.com/event/Snow-Camp/6343</a></p> <p>Pour l'agenda: <a href=\"https://snowcamp2016.sched.org/grid/\" class=\"linkified\">https://snowcamp2016.sched.org/grid/</a> Il est possible de passer par la formation professionnelle via notre partenaire Oxiane (cependant vous ne bénéficez plus du tarif early bird): <a href=\"http://www.oxiane.com/snowcamp-2016/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.oxiane.com/snowcamp-2016/</a></p>",

        "description": "<p><b>Please answer meetup questions with non-empty strings.  We'll sort RSVPs so that empty strings are at the bottom.</b></p> <p>In this talk, we will discuss how we use Spark as part of a hybrid RDBMS architecture that includes Hadoop and HBase. The optimizer evaluates each query and sends OLTP traffic (including CRUD queries) to HBase and OLAP traffic to Spark. We will focus on the challenges of handling the tradeoffs inherent in an integrated architecture that simultaneously handles real-time and batch traffic. Lessons learned include: - Embedding Spark into a RDBMS - Running Spark on Yarn and isolating OLTP traffic from OLAP traffic - Accelerating the generation of Spark RDDs from HBase - Customizing the Spark UI The lessons learned can also be applied to other hybrid systems, such as Lambda architectures.</p> <p><b>John Leach </b>is the CTO and Co-Founder of <a href=\"http://www.splicemachine.com/\">Splice Machine</a>.

Se parte de más de treinta mil usuarios y el objetivo de número de usuarios es alcanzar los cien mil en los próximos dos años. Y por supuesto, con migración desde la plataforma antigua incluída, alta disponibilidad, y una mejora de tiempo de respuesta del servidor de, al menos, un 500% respecto a la versión anterior. Estos son los requisitos de partida del proyecto en el que he estado trabajando el último año. El equipo del proyecto, formado por grandes profesionales, contábamos con importantes aliados, entre los que se cuentan Drupal, Nginx,Docker, Ansible, MongoDB, Node.JS, Apache Mesosy Amazon Web Services. Se describirá el proyecto en relativo detalle, centrándonos en el apartado de infraestructura y repasando las novedosas tecnologías que se han empleado para hacerlo posible, así como los problemas encontrados durante el diseño y desarrollo, y las soluciones implementadas para solventarlos.</p> <p>Como regalo de reyes: Recordad liberar la plaza si no podeis asistir (the sooner the better).</p> <p>Saludos</p>",

In some cases, even longer. The Cloud Foundry Foundation offers a unique approach to gaining committer in as little as six weeks, which we call the Cloud Foundry Dojo. The program is derived from the Pivotal labs Dojo program. It allows developers to master Cloud Foundry by working shoulder to shoulder on the open-source project with other Cloud Foundry engineers. Qualified engineers from the Cloud Foundry community can participate in pair programming with committers on a Cloud Foundry project team, gain invaluable experience with the core technology and the unique agile development environment, and make direct contributions to the codebase. Participation typically lasts 6-12 weeks.</p> <p>·  Become part of the EMC Cloud Foundry Technical Community</p> <p>·  Learn DevOps practices and culture</p> <p>·  Accelerate your knowledge of the Cloud Foundry platform</p> <p>·   Develop relationships with all the key contributors</p> <p>·  Lead the next wave of innovation</p> <p>EMC's Cambridge-based Dojo will host software developers from EMC customers and partners, along with developers from EMC's own software engineering ranks. The facility itself is designed as an open shared environment that is purpose-built for software developers to write code together through the agile pair programming/TDD model. The facility will also host regular Meetups with the local Cloud Foundry community.</p> <p><b>Please RSVP by Signing up for the Meetup</b></p>",

Hadoop 2.0 implements a distributed file system, HDFS, and a computing framework, YARN, that allows distributed applications to easily harness the power of clustered computing on extremely large data sets. Over the past decade, the primary application framework has been MapReduce - a functional programming paradigm that lends itself extremely well to designing distributed applications, but carries with it a lot of computational overhead.</p> <p>Many excellent analytical applications and algorithms have been written in MapReduce, creating an ecosystem that has made Hadoop continue to grow as an effective tool. However, more complex algorithms, especially machine learning algorithms, often require extremely complex chains of jobs to conform to the MapReduce functional paradigm. Enter Spark, an open source Apache project that uses the cluster resource daemons of Hadoop (particularly HDFS and other Hadoop data stores) but allows developers to break out of the MapReduce paradigm and write distributed applications that are much faster.</p> <p>Spark also distributes applications to a cluster by using distributed executor processes- Spark developers write applications that are intended to work on local data; however unlike with MapReduce, these executors are in communication with each other and can share data via an external store. Spark is intended to work with Hadoop data stores, but can be run in a stand alone mode, or if you already have a Hadoop 2.0 cluster- then Spark can be run with YARN. The flexibility that Spark provides means that it can be used to implement more complex algorithms and applications previously unavailable to MapReduce patterns.</p> <p>Spark can run in memory, making it hundreds of times faster than disk based MapReduce, and provides a programming API in Scala, Java, and Python - making it more accessible to developers. Spark has an interactive command line interface to quickly interact with data on the cluster, and applications for writing SQL-like queries with Spark and a fairly complete Machine Learning library. Importantly, it can also execute Graph algorithms that were previously unable to be ported to MapReduce frameworks.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What You Will Learn</b></p> <p>In this one day workshop, we will introduce Spark at a high level context. Spark is fundamentally different than writing MapReduce jobs so no prior Hadoop experience is needed. You will learn how to interact with Spark on the command line and conduct rapid in-memory data analyses. We will then work on writing Spark applications to perform large cluster based analyses including SQL-like aggregations, machine learning applications, and Graph algorithms and search. The course will be conducted in Python using PySpark.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Course Outline</b></p> <p>The workshop will cover the following topics:</p> <p>• Interacting with Spark via the Spark Shell</p> <p>• Interacting with RDDs and other distributed data</p> <p>• Creating Spark applications in Python</p> <p>• Submitting Spark applications to the cluster</p> <p>• Aggregations and Queries using Spark SQL</p> <p>• Machine Learning with Spark MLLib</p> <p>• Graph computing with Spark GraphX</p> <p>After this course you should understand how to build distributed applications using Python and Spark, particularly for conducting analyses. You will be introduced to Spark applications and be able to run Spark SQL queries on a distributed database, conduct machine learning with SparkMLib, and execute graph algorithms with Spark GraphX.</p> <p><br/><b>Prerequisites</b></p> <p>You must be familiar with Python before participating in this course, and have familiarity with the command line on Linux systems. You must also prepare a stand-alone Spark machine either running on top of a pseudo-distributed Hadoop node or a single node Spark machine. Note that Spark can run on many operating systems, but it is recommended that you use Spark on top of a Linux distribution. Before attending the course ensure you have the following set up:</p> <p>• Install Python and a POSIX compliant Terminal</p> <p>• Install Spark on a Single Node (pseudo-distributed) - instructions are posted on the <a href=\"http://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/\">DDL blog</a>.</p> <p>• Download the example datasets - the location of the datasets will be emailed to registered students.</p> <p>You should also be familiar with Python and the command line, you can review these topics:</p> <p>Python programming: <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\"><a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a></a></p> <p>Using the terminal: <a href=\"http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/\"><a href=\"http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/\" class=\"linkified\">http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Instructor: Keegan Hines</b></p> <p>Keegan Hines is a Data Scientist with IronNet Cybersecurity, focusing on large-scale machine learning applications in cyber defense.</p> <p>He received a PhD from the University of Texas with a focus on computational statistics and neuroscience during which time he taught multiple seminars on statistical methods and R. He is interested in challenging problems in machine learning and distributed computing.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://districtdatalabs.squarespace.com/fast-data-apps-with-spark-and-python\">Register Now</a></b></p>",

The evening fly-in with the birds are amazing  to watch and photograph. Hopefully we will have some clouds in the west for a beautiful sunset and none to the east for the full moon rise.</p> <p><br/>We will meet at the Home Depot and determine car pools. The trip down there is about an hour and a half, maybe a little more.  We will re-group at the visitor's center.</p> <p><b>If you would prefer to meet the group at the visitor's center, we should be there 12:30-12:45pm.  Please let us know in a comment so we don't wait for you in Albuquerque.</b></p> <p><br/>The tour loop is only five miles, but we'll make many stops before finally finding a good spot for sunset/moon rise to photograph as well as the birds flying in to roost for the night. Sunset and the full moon rise are approximately 5:30. We will probably be there until almost 6 pm - for anyone interested we could stop for dinner in either Socorro or the Owl Cafe.</p> <p>Expect to get back to ABQ till about 8:30pm if we stay for dinner. Please indicate if you are interested in stopping for dinner.</p> <p><br/>Here is the Bosque website <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Bosque_del_Apache/\"><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Bosque_del_Apache/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Bosque_del_Apache/</a></a> or for more info: &lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http://friendsofthebosque.org&lt;/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http://friendsofthebosque.org&lt;/a&gt</a>;</p> <p><br/>Admission is $5 per car, National Parks passes (or the like) are accepted.</p> <p><br/>Please bring the following:</p> <p><br/>-Snacks and drinks for the afternoon.</p> <p>-Warm clothes--layers are usually the best, and be sure to bring a warm hat and gloves! It will get cold as it gets darker.</p> <p>-If you have a long lens, bring it!</p> <p>-A tripod for taking sunset/moon rise pictures.</p> <p>-Cash to for admission and gas (if you carpool with someone)</p>",

        "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>Ever wondered how to build a robot that talks to you? Thanks to Watson and the emergence of cheap, hackable computer boards it's never been easier to do. During this session we'll give a few best practices and a high level intro to Watson in the IoT space.</p> <p>AGENDA:<br/>6:30 - 7:00 PM: Networking, food and drinks<br/>7:00 - 9:00 PM: Cognitive IoT presentation (Michael and Josh)<br/>9:00 - 9:30 PM: Networking / Q&amp;A</p> <p>Audience:<br/>A good mix would be 70% developers &amp; technical decision makers, 30% business. We won't be doing a hands on lab but there will be some light sample code.</p> <p>Bio Michael Ludden:<br/>Michael Ludden works in the IBM Watson group in Developer Relations &amp; Product Management. Previously, Michael was Developer Marketing Manager Lead at Google, Head of Developer Marketing at Samsung, a Developer Evangelist at HTC, Global Director of Developer Relations at startups Quixey &amp; Nexmo, and was involved at various times in development, product marketing, co-founding startups, tech show hosting, and even cruise-ship singing (don’t ask). Michael has a degree from UCLA and is thrilled to share more about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing.<br/>A one-time developer, Michael has for the last decade been a frequent speaker, panelist and keynote speaker at conferences such as Mobile World Conference Barcelona, IFA in Berlin, CES, multiple Droidcons, Appsworld, GDC, Google IO, Linux Foundation Apache Big Data, AnDevCon, OSCON, Samsung Developer Conference, Appnation, SXSW, EvansData Developer Relations Conference, TechCrunch Disrupt, as well at developer meetups such as Google Developer Groups, MoDev, SVAndroid, Mobile Monday and more.</p> <p>Bio Josh Zheng:<br/>Josh Zheng is a product manager for Watson Developer Cloud. He has an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering and a master's degree in Robotics. Before joining IBM, he worked at a data mining company in DC, where he wrote software to analyze political systems around the world. Josh is very interested in Artificial Intelligence and how it can/will improve the interaction between human and computers.</p> <p>Cognitive IoT: Making the Internet of Things Deliver for All of Us</p> <p>The early visionaries of the Internet of Things, IBM’s thought leaders among them, foresaw a time when practically any physical object could be equipped with sensors and hooked up to the Internet to translate the physical world into digital information.<br/>They were focusing on factory assembly lines, electrical grids, automobiles, highways, buildings, and the like. The goal was to gather streams of information from sensors that could be used to automate processes such as balancing supply and demand in a power grid and operate more efficiently.<br/>Today, these applications have become mainstream, so it’s time to take advantage of a second generation of Internet of Things technologies and capabilities something we at IBM call the Cognitive Internet of Things.<br/>Cognitive IoT technologies will make it possible for business leaders to understand what’s happening in the world more deeply. By infusing intelligence into systems and processes, businesses will be able to not only do things more efficiently, but to improve customer satisfaction, to discover new business opportunities, and to anticipate risks and threats so they can better deal with them.<br/>As powerful as today’s sensor networks are, they aren’t up to the task of unlocking the complex interrelationships between people, places and things that drive business and the economy. To reach the next level, businesses need cognitive technologies that enable them to gather and integrate data from many types of sensors and other sources, to reason over that data, and to learn from their interactions with it.</p> <p>#IBMWatson</p>",

Man made monuments are often built to impress or leave you in awe. Monumental refers to something extraordinary in size or power. The massive rock monoliths guarding this canyon stand as a warning. Heed the warning if you are simply looking to stretch your legs. Pay no attention to the distance of this hike. It will certainly take most of the day. Route finding skills will be put to the test. It is a rough, rocky trail followed by a brutal bushwhack with bouldering and canyoneering into an area few others have visited offering yet another side of the mysterious Superstitions with the hint of some obscure history. </p> <p>\n\nRead more at: <a href=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=1894\"><a href=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=1894\" class=\"linkified\">http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=1894</a></a><br/>Copyright © 2015 hikearizona.com</p> <p>It is seldom hiked and is a challenge.  </p> <p>If you are not an intermediate hiker or better, then this is not for you.

While the popularity of Spark and GraphX is growing, the relatively young technology has yet to explore the breadth of graph problems that exist in the field. In order to examine and gain insights into the capabilities of GraphX, this thesis approaches the framework with the intention of implementing a solution to the Maximum Flow Problem, a complex graph problem without a trivial distributed approach. Specifically, the implementation is to be based on the serial Push-Relabel algorithm. An original MapReduce-based approach to the problem is presented, as well as an implementation of the approach in GraphX. In addition to the implementation, experimentation and deployment to an Amazon EC2 cluster allowed observations on caching and checkpointing intervals to be made.</p> <p>Ryan Langewisch - Bio</p> <p>Ryan Langewisch graduated from Colorado School of Mines with his BS in Computer Science in December of 2014, and his MS in Computer Science in December of 2015. For his Master's work, Ryan gained exposure to algorithms in the context of distributed computing, ultimately leading to his thesis, \"A Performance Study of an Implementation of the Push-Relabel Maximum Flow Algorithm in Apache Spark's GraphX.\" In 2016, Ryan will join ReadyTalk in Denver, CO as a software engineer.</p> <p><br/>Demo of 4-node Raspberry Pi Spark cluster - Abstract</p> <p>Raspberry Pi computer board are inexpensive, low power, fairly capable devices that can be easily networked. There have been numerous examples of small multi-node systems that have been constructed. I have built a 4-node, 16 core system and installed Spark. This talk will give some of the details and lessons learned from constructing the system and describe a simple use case. The goal of this project was to gain experience building a distributed system and learn more about Spark. Andrew Weekley - Bio</p> <p>Andrew Weekley is a Data Analyst at the National Renewable Energy Lab working in the Strategic Energy Analysis Center. He works on solar insolation data sets, primarily on the creation of synthetic data that is used in solar integration studies. He also performs general time-series analysis, and inter-comparison of ground measured, modeled and forecasted solar insolation data sets.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In our 4th HBase meetup, we will explore two methods for getting more out of your HBase cluster.</p> <p>\n\nThe first method is extending HBase capabilities by using a 3rd party library which implements transactions over the HBase cluster. </p> <p><br/>The second method uses the new caching feature which HBase keeps improving, in order to boost the cluster's performance. </p> <p><br/><i><b>Transactions in HBase - Ehud Lev, Gigya</b></i></p> <p>---------------------------------------------</p> <p><br/>We all use HBase as a key value store, but what if we need to do a little more than that? The problem: Atomic operation in HBase is on the row level only. What if we want to update more than one row in one table? or even one row in 2 different tables? What if we want the ability to write transactions similar to those in SQL databases?In this lecture, Ehud will talk about two different “open source”  libraries (Haeinsa and Tephra), that solve this problem on top of HBase.How does this work? What are the API usages?What is the cost? </p> <p><br/><b><i><br/></i></b> <b><i>Advanced caching in HBase - Yaniv Yancovich, Gigya</i></b></p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>\n\n\nAs with any database, optimized I/O is a critical concern to HBase. In fact, it is preferable to avoid performing any I/O at all.  What this means is that memory utilization and caching structures are of utmost importance. Proper utilization of caches will improve the query performance in HBase.  If someone is looking to optimize caching, it is worthwhile to understand the HBase data structures since optimization will vary with each use case.  In this meeting, Yaniv  will explore the various cache configurations available today in HBase and provide several tips .</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Schedule</b></p> <p>18:00 - 18:30  Gathering (Gigya, Azrieli Towers (Triangle), 43rd Floor, Tel Aviv-Yafo) </p> <p>18:30 - 19:30  <i>Transactions in HBase - Ehud Lev, Gigya</i></p> <p>19:30 - 20:00  <i>Advanced caching in HBase - Yaniv Yancovich, Gigya</i></p> <p>20:00 - Q&amp;A and Open discussion </p>",
